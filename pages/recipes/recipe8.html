        <p>
          Sour Fish Curry, or <strong>Ambul Thiyal</strong>, is a traditional
          Sri Lankan dish known for its tangy and spicy flavors. This dry curry
          is made with firm fish (like tuna), goraka (a souring agent), and a
          blend of aromatic spices. The dish is cooked until the fish absorbs
          all the flavors, resulting in a rich and tangy curry that pairs
          perfectly with rice.

          <li>Salt to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Fish</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Clean the fish pieces and pat them dry.</li>
          <li>
            Marinate the fish with
            <strong>turmeric powder, chili powder</strong>, and a pinch of
            <strong>salt</strong>. Set aside for 15-20 minutes.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Goraka</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            If using <strong>goraka</strong>, soak the pieces in a little warm
            water for 10 minutes to soften them.
          </li>
          <li>
            If using <strong>tamarind paste</strong>, dissolve it in 1/4 cup of
            water and set aside.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 3: Cook the Curry</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Heat <strong>coconut oil</strong> in a pan over medium heat.</li>
          <li>Add <strong>mustard seeds</strong> and let them splutter.</li>
          <li>
            Add <strong>curry leaves, sliced onions, garlic, ginger</strong>,
            and <strong>green chilies</strong>. Sauté until the onions are
            golden brown.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the marinated fish pieces and cook for 2-3 minutes until lightly
            browned.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the <strong>goraka pieces</strong> (or tamarind paste mixture)
            and <strong>roasted curry powder</strong>. Mix well.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pour in <strong>1/2 cup water</strong> and bring to a gentle boil.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for
            <strong>15-20 minutes</strong>, stirring occasionally, until the
            fish is cooked and the curry is thick and dry.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 4: Adjust Seasoning</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Taste the curry and adjust <strong>salt</strong> and
            <strong>spice levels</strong> if needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the curry is too dry, add a splash of water and cook for a few
            more minutes.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 5: Serve</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Garnish with fresh <strong>curry leaves</strong> if desired.</li>
          <li>
            Serve hot with <strong>steamed rice</strong> or
            <strong>roti</strong>.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips for Perfect Sour Fish Curry:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Use <strong>firm fish</strong> like tuna or mackerel, as they hold
            their shape well during cooking.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Goraka</strong> is the traditional souring agent, but if
            unavailable, tamarind paste works as a substitute.
          </li>
          <li>
            Adjust the amount of <strong>green chilies</strong> and
            <strong>chili powder</strong> to suit your spice tolerance.
          </li>
          <li>
            For a smokier flavor, briefly roast the curry leaves before adding
            them to the dish.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cultural Significance:</h2>
        <p>
          Ambul Thiyal is a signature dish from the southern region of Sri
          Lanka, where fish is a dietary staple. The use of goraka and spices
          reflects the island’s love for bold, tangy flavors. This dish is often
          prepared for family gatherings and special occasions, symbolizing the
          coastal culinary heritage of Sri Lanka.
