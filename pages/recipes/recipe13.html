        <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Ingredients</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Finely chop <strong>1 large red onion</strong> and set aside.</li>
          <li>

        <h2>Tips for Perfect Spicy Onion Sambol:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Use <strong>fresh red onions</strong> for the best flavor and
            crunch.
          </li>
          <li>
            Adjust the number of chilies based on your spice tolerance. For a
            milder version, remove the seeds from the chilies before crushing.
          </li>
          <li>
            If Maldive fish is unavailable, you can substitute it with a small
            amount of <strong>fish sauce</strong> or omit it entirely.
          </li>
          <li>
            For a smoother texture, grind the onions and chilies together in a
            mortar and pestle.
          </li>
          <li>
            Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for
            up to 2 days.
          </li>
        </ul>
