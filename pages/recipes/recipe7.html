          Lankan condiment made with fried eggplant, onions, green chilies, and

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>2 medium eggplants (wambatu) (cut into thin strips or cubes)</li>
          <li>1 large onion (thinly sliced)</li>
          <li>2-3 green chilies (sliced, adjust to taste)</li>
          <li>2 garlic cloves (minced)</li>
          <li>1-inch ginger (minced)</li>
          <li>1 tsp mustard seeds</li>
          <li>1 tsp turmeric powder</li>
          <li>1/2 cup vinegar</li>
          <li>2-3 tbsp sugar (adjust to taste)</li>
          <li>1/2 tsp chili powder (optional, for extra heat)</li>
          <li>1/2 cup oil (for frying)</li>
          <li>Salt to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Eggplant</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Cut the eggplants into thin strips or small cubes.</li>
          <li>
            Sprinkle <strong>salt</strong> over the eggplant pieces and let them
            sit for <strong>15-20 minutes</strong>. This helps remove bitterness
            and excess moisture.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rinse the eggplant pieces and pat them dry with a clean cloth or
            paper towel.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 2: Fry the Eggplant</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Heat <strong>oil</strong> in a deep pan or wok over medium heat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fry the eggplant pieces in batches until they are golden brown and
            crispy. Remove and drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 3: Prepare the Pickle Base</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In the same pan, remove excess oil, leaving about 2
            <strong>tablespoons</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>Add <strong>mustard seeds</strong> and let them splutter.</li>
          <li>
            Add <strong>sliced onions, green chilies, garlic</strong>, and
            <strong>ginger</strong>. Sauté until the onions are soft and golden.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 4: Add the Sauce</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Add <strong>turmeric powder, chili powder</strong> (if using), and
            <strong>salt</strong>. Mix well.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pour in the <strong>vinegar</strong> and add <strong>sugar</strong>.
            Stir until the sugar dissolves.
          </li>
          <li>
            Simmer the mixture for <strong>5-7 minutes</strong> until the sauce
            thickens slightly.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 5: Combine the Eggplant and Sauce</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Add the fried eggplant pieces to the pan and mix well to coat them
            with the sauce.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cook for another <strong>2-3 minutes</strong> to allow the flavors
            to meld.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 6: Cool and Store</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Remove the pan from heat and let the pickle cool completely.</li>
          <li>
            Transfer to a clean, airtight jar and store in the refrigerator.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips for Perfect Eggplant Pickle:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Use <strong>fresh eggplants</strong> for the best texture and
            flavor.
          </li>
          <li>
            Adjust the amount of <strong>sugar</strong> and
            <strong>vinegar</strong> to suit your taste. Some prefer it sweeter,
            while others like it tangier.
          </li>
          <li>
            For a healthier version, you can bake or air-fry the eggplant
            instead of deep-frying.
          </li>
          <li>
            This pickle tastes even better after a day or two, as the flavors
            develop further.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cultural Significance:</h2>
