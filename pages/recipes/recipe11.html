        <p>
          String Hoppers, known as <strong>Idiyappam</strong> in Sri Lanka, are
          delicate, steamed rice flour noodles that are a staple in Sri Lankan
          cuisine. These thin, noodle-like strands are made from a simple dough
          of rice flour, water, and salt, pressed through a special mold and
          steamed to perfection. String Hoppers are incredibly versatile and are
          often served for breakfast or dinner with coconut sambol, curry, or
          even sweetened coconut milk. Their light texture and mild flavor make
          them a favorite among both locals and visitors.

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>2 cups rice flour</li>
          <li>1 cup hot water</li>
          <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
          <li>1 tsp oil (for greasing)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In a large mixing bowl, combine
            <strong>2 cups of rice flour</strong> and
            <strong>1/2 tsp salt</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Gradually add <strong>1 cup of hot water</strong> while mixing with
            a spoon or your hands.
          </li>
          <li>
            Knead the mixture into a smooth, pliable dough. If the dough feels
            dry, add a little more hot water, one tablespoon at a time.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 2: Shape the String Hoppers</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Lightly grease the string hopper mold (idiyappam press) with
            <strong>1 tsp of oil</strong> to prevent sticking.
          </li>
          <li>Take a small portion of the dough and place it into the mold.</li>
          <li>
            Press the dough through the mold onto a steaming plate or banana
            leaf, forming circular nests of thin noodles.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 3: Steam the String Hoppers</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Fill a steamer with water and bring it to a boil.</li>
          <li>Place the prepared string hopper plates into the steamer.</li>
          <li>
            Steam for <strong>5-7 minutes</strong>, or until the string hoppers
            are cooked and firm.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 4: Serve</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Carefully remove the string hoppers from the steamer.</li>
          <li>
            Serve warm with <strong>coconut sambol</strong>,
            <strong>curry</strong>, or <strong>sweetened coconut milk</strong>.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips for Perfect String Hoppers:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Use <strong>fine rice flour</strong> for a smooth texture. If the
            flour is coarse, sieve it before use.
          </li>
          <li>
            The dough should be soft but not sticky. Adjust the water quantity
            as needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you don’t have a string hopper mold, you can use a pasta maker
            with a small-hole disc.
          </li>
          <li>
            Steam the string hoppers immediately after shaping to prevent them
            from drying out.
          </li>
          <li>
            For extra flavor, add a pinch of <strong>cumin seeds</strong> or
            <strong>grated coconut</strong> to the dough.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cultural Significance:</h2>
        <p>
          String Hoppers hold a special place in Sri Lankan culture, often
          served during breakfast or dinner as a light and wholesome meal. They
          are a common feature at festive occasions, religious ceremonies, and
          family gatherings. In rural areas, string hoppers are traditionally
          made fresh each morning, showcasing the simplicity and resourcefulness
          of Sri Lankan cooking. Paired with spicy sambols or rich curries, they
          represent the perfect balance of flavors and textures in Sri Lankan
          cuisine.
