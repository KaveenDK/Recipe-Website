        <h2>Tips for Perfect Bibikkan:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Use <strong>freshly grated coconut</strong> for the best flavor and
            texture. If using desiccated coconut, soak it in warm water to
            rehydrate.
          </li>
          <li>Adjust the sweetness by adding more or less jaggery or sugar.</li>
          <li>
            For a richer flavor, toast the spices (cardamom, nutmeg, and
            cinnamon) before adding them to the batter.
          </li>
          <li>
            Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up
            to <strong>3 days</strong> or in the refrigerator for up to
            <strong>1 week</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>Serve with a cup of tea or coffee for a delightful treat.</li>
        </ul>
