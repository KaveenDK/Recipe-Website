        <p>
          Milk Rice, or <strong>Kiribath</strong>, is a traditional Sri Lankan
          dish made with rice and coconut milk. It is often served during
          special occasions, festivals, and celebrations. The creamy, slightly
          sweet flavor of the coconut milk pairs perfectly with the soft, sticky
          rice, making it a comforting and festive dish.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>1 cup white rice (preferably short-grain or medium-grain)</li>
          <li>2 cups water</li>
          <li>1 cup thick coconut milk</li>
          <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
          <li>Optional: A pinch of turmeric for color</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h3>Step 1: Rinse the Rice</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Rinse the rice thoroughly under cold water until the water runs
            clear.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 2: Cook the Rice</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In a medium-sized pot, combine the rinsed rice and
            <strong>2 cups of water</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to low,
            cover, and simmer for <strong>15-20 minutes</strong>, or until the
            rice is fully cooked and the water is absorbed.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 3: Add Coconut Milk</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Once the rice is cooked, add the
            <strong>thick coconut milk</strong> and <strong>salt</strong> (and a
            pinch of turmeric if desired for a golden color).
          </li>
          <li>
            Stir gently to combine, ensuring the coconut milk is evenly
            distributed.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 4: Simmer and Thicken</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Cook the rice and coconut milk mixture over low heat, stirring
            occasionally, for <strong>5-7 minutes</strong>, or until the mixture
            thickens and becomes creamy.
          </li>
          <li>Be careful not to let it stick to the bottom of the pot.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 5: Shape the Milk Rice</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Transfer the cooked rice mixture to a flat tray or plate.</li>
          <li>
            Use a spatula or the back of a spoon to spread it evenly into a flat
            layer, about <strong>1-2 cm thick</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Let it cool slightly, then cut it into diamond-shaped or square
            pieces.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 6: Serve</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
          <li>
            Traditionally, Kiribath is paired with
            <strong>lunu miris</strong> (a spicy onion and chili relish) or
            <strong>jaggery</strong> (palm sugar) for a sweet contrast.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips for Perfect Milk Rice:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Use <strong>thick coconut milk</strong> for a rich and creamy
            texture.
          </li>
          <li>Stir gently while cooking to avoid breaking the rice grains.</li>
          <li>
            If the mixture becomes too dry, add a splash of coconut milk or
            water to adjust the consistency.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cultural Significance:</h2>
        <p>
          Kiribath holds a special place in Sri Lankan culture and is often
          prepared for <strong>New Year celebrations, birthdays</strong>, and
          <strong>religious ceremonies</strong>. It symbolizes prosperity and is
          a staple dish during festive occasions.
