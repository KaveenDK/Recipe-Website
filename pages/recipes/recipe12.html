        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>2 cups rice flour</li>
          <li>1 cup grated coconut (fresh or desiccated)</li>
          <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
          <li>Water (as needed, approximately 1 cup)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Pittu Mixture</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In a large mixing bowl, combine
            <strong>2 cups of rice flour</strong>,
            <strong>1 cup of grated coconut</strong>, and
            <strong>1/2 tsp salt</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Gradually add water, a little at a time, while mixing with your
            hands. The mixture should resemble coarse crumbs and hold together
            when pressed lightly.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 2: Assemble the Pittu Maker</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Fill the bottom section of the pittu maker or steamer with water and
            bring it to a boil.
          </li>
          <li>
            Layer the pittu mixture into the pittu maker, alternating with thin
            layers of grated coconut (optional for extra flavor).
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 3: Steam the Pittu</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Place the pittu maker on the steamer and steam for
            <strong>8-10 minutes</strong>, or until the pittu is cooked through
            and firm.
          </li>
          <li>
            To check if it’s done, insert a skewer into the pittu. If it comes
            out clean, the pittu is ready.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 4: Serve</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Carefully remove the pittu from the steamer and let it cool
            slightly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Serve warm with <strong>coconut milk</strong>,
            <strong>curry</strong>, or <strong>sambol</strong>.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips for Perfect Pittu:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Use <strong>fine rice flour</strong> for a smoother texture. If the
            flour is coarse, sieve it before use.
          </li>
          <li>
            The mixture should be crumbly but moist enough to hold its shape
            when pressed. Adjust the water quantity as needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            For extra flavor, add a pinch of <strong>cumin seeds</strong> or
            <strong>cardamom powder</strong> to the mixture.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you don’t have a pittu maker, you can use a steamer or a colander
            lined with cheesecloth.
          </li>
          <li>
            Serve pittu immediately after steaming for the best texture and
            flavor.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cultural Significance:</h2>
        <p>
          Pittu is a beloved dish in Sri Lankan cuisine, often enjoyed as a
          comforting breakfast or dinner. It is a symbol of simplicity and
          resourcefulness, showcasing the use of readily available ingredients
          like rice flour and coconut. In rural areas, pittu is traditionally
          made fresh each morning, reflecting the close connection between Sri
          Lankan culture and its agricultural roots. Paired with creamy coconut
          milk or spicy curries, pittu represents the harmonious blend of
          flavors and textures that define Sri Lankan cooking.
