        <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Crab</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Clean the crabs thoroughly, removing the gills and any impurities.
            Cut them into pieces and set aside.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 2: Sauté the Aromatics</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Heat <strong>1 tbsp oil</strong> in a large pan over medium heat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add <strong>1/2 tsp mustard seeds</strong> and
            <strong>1/2 tsp fenugreek seeds</strong>. Let them splutter.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add <strong>1 chopped onion</strong>,
            <strong>2 minced garlic cloves</strong>,
            <strong>1-inch minced ginger</strong>,
            <strong>2 sliced green chilies</strong>, and
            <strong>1 sprig of curry leaves</strong>. Sauté until the onions are
            soft and golden.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 3: Add the Spices</h3>
        <ol>

        <h2>Tips for Perfect Crab Curry:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Use <strong>fresh crab</strong> for the best flavor. If using frozen
            crab, thaw it completely before cooking.
          </li>
          <li>
            Clean the crab thoroughly to remove any impurities and ensure a
            pleasant texture.
          </li>
          <li>
            Adjust the amount of green chilies and chili powder based on your
            spice tolerance.
          </li>
          <li>
            For a richer flavor, toast the spices (curry powder, turmeric,
            mustard seeds, and fenugreek seeds) in a dry pan before adding them
            to the curry.
          </li>
          <li>
            Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up
            to <strong>1 day</strong>. Reheat gently to avoid curdling the
            coconut milk.
          </li>
        </ul>
