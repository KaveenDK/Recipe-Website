          Mung Bean Curry is a light, nutritious, and flavorful Sri Lankan dish
          made with <strong>mung beans</strong>, <strong>coconut milk</strong>,
          and a blend of aromatic spices. This vegetarian curry is a staple in
          Sri Lankan households, often served with rice or roti. The mung beans

        <h2>Tips for Perfect Mung Bean Curry:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Soaking the mung beans reduces cooking time and makes them easier to
            digest.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use <strong>fresh coconut milk</strong> for the best flavor. If
            using canned coconut milk, shake well before use.
          </li>
          <li>
            For a richer flavor, toast the spices (curry powder, turmeric,
            mustard seeds, and cumin seeds) in a dry pan before adding them to
            the curry.
          </li>
          <li>
            Adjust the amount of green chilies based on your spice tolerance.
          </li>
          <li>
            Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up
            to <strong>2 days</strong>. Reheat gently to avoid curdling the
            coconut milk.
          </li>
        </ul>
