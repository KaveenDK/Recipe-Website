        <p>
          Cashew Curry is a rich and creamy Sri Lankan dish made with
          <strong>raw cashews</strong>, <strong>coconut milk</strong>, and a
          blend of aromatic spices. This vegetarian curry is a delightful
          combination of nutty flavors and creamy textures, making it a favorite
          among both vegetarians and non-vegetarians. The cashews absorb the
          flavors of the spices and coconut milk, creating a hearty and
          satisfying dish. Often served with rice or roti, Cashew Curry is a
          testament to Sri Lanka’s love for bold flavors and tropical
          ingredients.

        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Cashews</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Soak <strong>1 cup of raw cashews</strong> in warm water for
            <strong>1-2 hours</strong> to soften them. Drain and set aside.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 2: Sauté the Aromatics</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Heat <strong>1 tbsp oil</strong> in a large pan over medium heat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add <strong>1 chopped onion</strong>,
            <strong>2 minced garlic cloves</strong>,
            <strong>1-inch minced ginger</strong>,
            <strong>2 sliced green chilies</strong>, and
            <strong>1 sprig of curry leaves</strong>. Sauté until the onions are
            soft and golden.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 3: Add the Spices</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Add <strong>1 tbsp curry powder</strong>,
            <strong>1/2 tsp turmeric powder</strong>, and
            <strong>1/2 tsp chili powder</strong> (if using). Stir well to coat
            the aromatics.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 4: Cook the Cashews</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Add the soaked cashews to the pan and mix well with the spices.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pour in <strong>1 cup of thin coconut milk</strong> (or water) and
            simmer for <strong>10-15 minutes</strong>, allowing the cashews to
            absorb the flavors.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 5: Add Thick Coconut Milk</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Stir in <strong>1 cup of thick coconut milk</strong> and simmer for
            another <strong>5-7 minutes</strong>. Avoid boiling vigorously to
            prevent the coconut milk from curdling.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 6: Adjust Seasoning and Serve</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Taste the curry and adjust the salt and spice levels as needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Serve hot with <strong>rice</strong>, <strong>roti</strong>, or
            <strong>string hoppers</strong>.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips for Perfect Cashew Curry:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Use <strong>raw cashews</strong> for this recipe, as roasted cashews
            will not absorb the flavors as well.
          </li>
          <li>
            Soak the cashews for at least 1 hour to ensure they soften and cook
            evenly.
          </li>
          <li>
            For a richer flavor, toast the spices (curry powder, turmeric, and
            chili powder) in a dry pan before adding them to the curry.
          </li>
          <li>
            Adjust the amount of green chilies and chili powder based on your
            spice tolerance.
          </li>
          <li>
            Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up
            to 2 days. Reheat gently to avoid curdling the coconut milk.
          </li>
        </ul>
