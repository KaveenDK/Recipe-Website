      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Ingredients</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Shred the rotis into small pieces and set aside.</li>
        <li>
          If using meat, cook and shred it beforehand. You can use leftover
          curry or grilled meat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Chop all vegetables (onion, carrot, cabbage, green chilies, garlic,
          and ginger).
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Step 2: Cook the Vegetables and Meat</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large pan or flat grill over medium heat.</li>
        <li>
          Add <strong>curry leaves, onions, garlic</strong>, and
          <strong>ginger</strong>. Sauté until the onions are golden brown.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add <strong>green chilies, carrots</strong>, and
          <strong>cabbage</strong>. Stir-fry for 3-4 minutes until the
          vegetables are tender but still crisp.
        </li>
        <li>If using meat, add it now and mix well.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Step 3: Add the Eggs</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Push the vegetable and meat mixture to one side of the pan.</li>
        <li>Crack the eggs into the empty space and scramble them.</li>
        <li>
          Once the eggs are cooked, mix them with the vegetables and meat.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Step 4: Add the Roti and Spices</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Add the shredded roti to the pan.</li>
        <li>
          Sprinkle <strong>turmeric powder, chili powder, curry powder</strong>,
          and <strong>salt</strong> over the roti.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mix everything thoroughly, ensuring the roti is well-coated with the
          spices and vegetables.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Step 5: Cook and Chop</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Use two spatulas or metal blades to chop and mix the roti
          continuously. This step is essential for the authentic texture and
          flavor of Kottu Roti.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cook for 5-7 minutes until the roti is heated through and slightly
          crispy.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Step 6: Adjust Seasoning</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Taste and adjust salt and spices if needed.</li>
        <li>
          For extra flavor, add a splash of <strong>soy sauce</strong> or
          <strong>chili sauce</strong>.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Step 7: Serve</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Transfer the Kottu Roti to a plate.</li>
        <li>
          Serve hot with <strong>chili sauce, ketchup</strong>, or a side of
          curry.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Tips for Perfect Kottu Roti:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Use <strong>day-old roti</strong> for the best texture, as fresh roti
          can become too soft.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can customize the dish by adding cheese, sausages, or seafood.
        </li>
        <li>
          The rhythmic chopping sound is part of the Kottu Roti experience. If
          you’re cooking at home, use two spatulas to mimic the traditional
          method.
        </li>
        <li>
          For a vegetarian version, skip the meat and add more vegetables like
          bell peppers, beans, or leeks.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Cultural Significance:</h2>
      <p>
        Kottu Roti is more than just a dish; it’s a cultural icon of Sri Lanka.
        Originating as a way to use leftover roti and curry, it has become a
