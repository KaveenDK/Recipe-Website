      <p>
        Hoppers, or Appa, are bowl-shaped pancakes made from a fermented batter
        of rice flour and coconut milk. They have a crispy edge and a soft,
        fluffy center, making them perfect for soaking up curries or sambols.
        Hoppers can be enjoyed plain, with an egg cracked into the center (egg
        hoppers), or sweetened with jaggery and spices (pani appa).
      </p>

      <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>2 cups rice flour (fine texture)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup coconut milk (thick)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar (for fermentation)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cooked rice (optional, for texture)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water (for blending)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water (for adjusting batter consistency)</li>
        <li>Coconut oil (for greasing the pan)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Batter</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Dissolve <strong>yeast</strong> and <strong>sugar</strong> in 1/4 cup
          of warm water. Let it sit for 10 minutes until frothy.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a blender, combine <strong>rice flour</strong>,
          <strong>coconut milk</strong>, <strong>cooked rice</strong>, and
          <strong>salt</strong>. Blend until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>Add the yeast mixture and blend again.</li>
        <li>
          Transfer the batter to a large bowl. Cover and let it ferment for
          <strong>6-8 hours</strong> or overnight. The batter should rise and
          become slightly bubbly.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Step 2: Adjust the Batter</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          After fermentation, check the consistency of the batter. It should be
          similar to pancake batter—thin enough to swirl but not too runny.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add water as needed to achieve the right consistency. Add a pinch of
          salt if required.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Step 3: Cook the Hoppers</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Heat a <strong>hopper pan</strong> or a small wok over medium heat.
          Lightly grease it with <strong>coconut oil</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour a ladleful of batter into the center of the pan. Quickly swirl
          the pan to spread the batter evenly and create a thin layer that coats
          the sides.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cover the pan with a lid and cook for
          <strong>2-3 minutes</strong> until the edges are crispy and the center
          is cooked through.
        </li>
        <li>
          For <strong>egg hoppers</strong>, crack an egg into the center of the
          hopper after swirling the batter. Cover and cook until the egg is set.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Step 4: Serve</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Carefully remove the hopper from the pan using a spatula.</li>
        <li>
          Serve hot with <strong>lunu miris</strong> (spicy onion relish),
          <strong>pol sambol</strong> (coconut relish), or your favorite curry.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Tips for Perfect Hoppers:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use a <strong>non-stick hopper pan</strong> for best results.</li>
        <li>
          If you don’t have cooked rice, you can skip it, but it adds a nice
          texture to the hoppers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Adjust the fermentation time based on the weather. In warmer climates,
          the batter may ferment faster.
        </li>
        <li>
          For <strong>sweet hoppers (pani appa)</strong>, add
          <strong>jaggery</strong> or <strong>sugar</strong>,
          <strong>cardamom powder</strong>, and a pinch of
          <strong>cinnamon</strong> to the batter.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Cultural Significance:</h2>
      <p>
        Hoppers are a staple in Sri Lankan cuisine and are often enjoyed for
        breakfast or dinner. They are a symbol of Sri Lanka’s culinary
        creativity, combining simple ingredients like rice and coconut into a
        versatile and delicious dish. Hoppers are also a must-have during
        festivals and special occasions, showcasing the island’s love for
        coconut-based dishes.
