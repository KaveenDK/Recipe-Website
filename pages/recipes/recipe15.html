        <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
        <p>
          Coconut Roti is a simple yet delicious Sri Lankan flatbread made with

          of <strong>salt</strong>. This versatile dish is a staple in Sri

          of grated coconut gives the roti a slightly sweet and nutty flavor,
          while its soft yet firm texture makes it perfect for pairing with
          curries, sambols, or even a cup of tea. Quick to prepare and requiring
          minimal ingredients, Coconut Roti is a favorite for busy mornings or
          comforting meals.

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
          <li>1 cup grated coconut (fresh or desiccated)</li>
          <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
          <li>1/2 cup water (adjust as needed)</li>
          <li>1 tbsp oil (for cooking)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Dough</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In a large mixing bowl, combine <strong>2 cups of flour</strong>,
            <strong>1 cup of grated coconut</strong>, and
            <strong>1/2 tsp salt</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Gradually add <strong>1/2 cup of water</strong> while mixing with
            your hands. Knead until the dough comes together and is smooth but
            not sticky. Add more water if needed, one tablespoon at a time.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 2: Shape the Roti</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Divide the dough into 6-8 equal portions and roll each into a ball.
          </li>
          <li>
            Flatten each ball into a disc (about 1/4 inch thick) using your
            hands or a rolling pin.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 3: Cook the Roti</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Heat a skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease it
            with <strong>1 tbsp oil</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place a roti on the skillet and cook for
            <strong>2-3 minutes</strong> on each side, or until golden brown
            spots appear.
          </li>
          <li>
            Repeat with the remaining dough, adding more oil to the skillet as
            needed.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 4: Serve</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Serve the roti warm with <strong>coconut sambol</strong>,
            <strong>curry</strong>, or <strong>lunu miris</strong>.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips for Perfect Coconut Roti:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Use <strong>freshly grated coconut</strong> for the best flavor and
            texture. If using desiccated coconut, soak it in warm water for 10
            minutes before adding it to the dough.
          </li>
          <li>
            The dough should be soft but not sticky. Adjust the water quantity
            as needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            For extra flavor, add a pinch of <strong>cumin seeds</strong> or
            <strong>chopped green chilies</strong> to the dough.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cook the roti on medium heat to ensure it cooks through without
            burning.
          </li>
          <li>
            Store leftover roti in an airtight container and reheat on a skillet
            before serving.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cultural Significance:</h2>
        <p>
          Coconut Roti is a beloved dish in Sri Lankan cuisine, reflecting the
          island’s reliance on coconut as a staple ingredient. It is a symbol of
          simplicity and resourcefulness, often made with ingredients readily
          available in rural households. This roti is a common feature in Sri
          Lankan breakfasts, providing a quick and satisfying start to the day.
          Its versatility and ease of preparation make it a favorite among
          families, and its comforting flavors evoke a sense of home and
          tradition. Coconut Roti is not just a meal but a celebration of Sri
          Lanka’s culinary heritage and tropical abundance.
