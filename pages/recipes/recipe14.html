        <p>
          Jackfruit Curry is a flavorful and hearty Sri Lankan dish made with
          <strong>young jackfruit</strong>, <strong>coconut milk</strong>, and a
          blend of aromatic spices. Known as <strong>Polos Curry</strong> in Sri
          Lanka, this dish is a vegetarian favorite, offering a meaty texture
          and rich flavor that appeals to both vegetarians and meat-lovers
          alike. The young jackfruit absorbs the spices and coconut milk
          beautifully, creating a creamy and satisfying curry. Often served with
          rice or roti, this dish is a testament to Sri Lanka’s love for bold
          flavors and tropical ingredients.

        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h3>Step 1: Prepare the Jackfruit</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            If using fresh young jackfruit, peel and chop it into bite-sized
            pieces. Remove the core and any seeds.
          </li>
          <li>
            Boil the jackfruit in salted water for
            <strong>10-15 minutes</strong> until tender. Drain and set aside.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 2: Sauté the Aromatics</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Heat <strong>1 tbsp oil</strong> in a large pan over medium heat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add <strong>1 chopped onion</strong>,
            <strong>2 minced garlic cloves</strong>,
            <strong>1-inch minced ginger</strong>,
            <strong>2 sliced green chilies</strong>, and
            <strong>1 sprig of curry leaves</strong>. Sauté until the onions are
            soft and golden.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 3: Add the Spices</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Add <strong>1 tbsp curry powder</strong>,
            <strong>1/2 tsp turmeric powder</strong>, and
            <strong>1/2 tsp chili powder</strong> (if using). Stir well to coat
            the aromatics.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 4: Cook the Jackfruit</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Add the boiled jackfruit to the pan and mix well with the spices.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pour in <strong>1 cup of thin coconut milk</strong> (or water) and
            simmer for <strong>10-15 minutes</strong>, allowing the jackfruit to
            absorb the flavors.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 5: Add Thick Coconut Milk</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Stir in <strong>1 cup of thick coconut milk</strong> and simmer for
            another <strong>5-7 minutes</strong>. Avoid boiling vigorously to
            prevent the coconut milk from curdling.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step 6: Adjust Seasoning and Serve</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Taste the curry and adjust the salt and spice levels as needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Serve hot with <strong>rice</strong>, <strong>roti</strong>, or
            <strong>string hoppers</strong>.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips for Perfect Jackfruit Curry:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Use <strong>young jackfruit</strong> for this recipe, as it has a
            neutral flavor and meaty texture. Mature jackfruit is sweet and not
            suitable for curries.
          </li>
          <li>
            If using canned jackfruit, rinse it thoroughly to remove any brine
            or preservatives.
          </li>
          <li>
            For a richer flavor, toast the spices (curry powder, turmeric, and
            chili powder) in a dry pan before adding them to the curry.
          </li>
          <li>
            Adjust the amount of green chilies and chili powder based on your
            spice tolerance.
          </li>
          <li>
            Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up
            to 2 days. Reheat gently to avoid curdling the coconut milk.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cultural Significance:</h2>
        <p>
          Jackfruit Curry, or <strong>Polos Curry</strong>, is a beloved dish in
          Sri Lankan cuisine, especially among vegetarians. The jackfruit tree
          is often referred to as the "poor man's meat" due to its versatility
          and nutritional value. In rural areas, jackfruit is a common
          ingredient, and this curry is a staple in many households. Its rich,
          creamy texture and bold flavors reflect the tropical abundance of Sri
          Lanka and the island’s tradition of using natural, locally sourced
          ingredients. Jackfruit Curry is not only a delicious meal but also a
          symbol of sustainability and resourcefulness in Sri Lankan culture.
